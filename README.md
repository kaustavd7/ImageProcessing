Three Problem Statements

## 1) The lava: antaragni
Sincere students are usually defamed as emotionless or rocks by their over-exuberant friends, probably because they can’t see studious students’ antaragni yet. Who says the rocks can’t float? Let the rock-n-roll play, and you will see rocks rocking with spectacles in the air. The lava is hot molten rock erupted from a volcano and the magma is hot fluid material below or within Earth’s crust. An enormous amount of lava erupted, it flowed like a river.

Gradually top portion of the lava first gets cooled due to air contact, creating floating rocks in the river. These rocks need to be accounted for in estimating the overall lava flow. After volcanic eruption, estimation of accurate lava flow is essential for emergency response planning, public safety, property protection, land use planning, and environmental impact assessment. You can imagine, that there is no method other than capturing a variety of images (via drones) and processing them for this assessment task.

The final lava-detected region is shown as a white color mask with the non-lava region as black. My task is to generate only the final output mask image for the given input image.
